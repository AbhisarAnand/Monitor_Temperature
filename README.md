# Monitor Temperature
Measures the temperature of the Raspberry Pi and records it in a JSON File. It sends an update email at the desired time (use crontab on the Raspberry Pi) and if there is any time where the temperature of the Pi is above the set threshold, it sends an email to the developers.

## Getting Started
